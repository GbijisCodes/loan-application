A short readme/note explaining:

   * How the calculation works
   * What assumptions were made
   * Potential improvements (e.g., adding interest rate or down payment option)




    How the calculation works
* The user selects a car model from a predefined list.
* Each car has a maximum funding amount (the highest loan value available).
The user can then:
* Adjust the loan amount slider (₦100,000 minimum up to the car’s max funding).
* Adjust the loan period slider (8–26 months).
* The system calculates the estimated monthly installment using a simple division formula:
Monthly Installment = (Loan Amount / Loan Period)
 

    Assumptions made
* The loan has no interest rate or extra fees applied.
* The loan period is measured in months.
* The maximum funding represents the upper limit of what can be borrowed for a specific car model.

    Possible Improvements
* Add an interest rate field to make the monthly installment more realistic
* An opttion for a downpayment to reduce the principal before calculation of the interest accrued.
